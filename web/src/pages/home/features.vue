              So far the fees have been collected and accounted for through a manual and paper-based method that is archaic by todayâ€™s technological standards. And like many manual methods, this system is full of inefficiencies that negatively affect all involved stakeholders notably the beneficiaries of the services (Clients), those who provide the services (service providers), and the local government authorities and national level regulators (Authorities and Regulators).
